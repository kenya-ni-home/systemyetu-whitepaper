_ _ _

*** Abstract ***
A fully decentralized governance system would enhance transparency, accountability, and trust between government agencies and citizens. Systemyetu aims to revolutionize the way African nations manage their public services by leveraging blockchain technology. This system offers a new model for governance, where decision-making, record-keeping, and service delivery are decentralized, reducing corruption and inefficiencies.

Systemyetu seeks to address key challenges, including:

Government Salary Payments: Ensuring timely and transparent disbursement of salaries to public servants, preventing fraud and delays.

Management of Public Services: Streamlining the operation and oversight of essential public services like schools, hospitals, and prisons.

Enhanced Accountability: Providing an open, tamper-proof platform where citizens can track government activities, ensuring transparency.

This system is designed to maintain the integrity of governance and ensure that the government remains accessible and accountable to the people it serves.
